Basic Economy tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable. However, you can cancel within 24 hours of booking for a full refund if booked at least 7 days before departure.

Main Cabin and higher fare classes allow changes and cancellations with applicable fees:
- Same-day changes: $75
- Advance changes: $200 domestic, $400 international
- Premium cabin changes: $500

Rebooking Options:

1. Online rebooking through our website or mobile app
2. Call our reservations team at 1-800-BOOK-NOW

When rebooking, you may need to pay:
- Change fee (if applicable)
- Fare difference if the new flight costs more
- No additional payment if the new fare is lower

For weather-related cancellations or airline operational issues, change fees are typically waived. We'll automatically rebook you on the next available flight at no extra cost.

Emergency rebooking is available for medical emergencies or family bereavement with proper documentation.
